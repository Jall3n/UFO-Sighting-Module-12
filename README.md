# UFO Sighting: Module 12 Challenge

## Purpose

To provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings we are tasked with allowing multiple users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time along with adding the table filters for city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

Here is an image of the website with the table unfiltered. What currently shows in the filters is the set placeholder so you know how to enter the information in the correct format.

Next we have an image showing the filters being applied. Additionally, we can filter on all or just one of the criteria.
- The image is filtering for state: nc

## Summary

- One drawback of this webpage: Dependent on how you format what you enter into the filter. So have to make sure spelling is correct. Why included the placeholder.


- Two additional recommendations for further development:
1. Include a clear filter button so you don't have to refresh the page to reset the table. 
2. For the filters include a drop down list of the options you can select. Can also have a clear/reset table option in the drop down list.
